# biblatex.csl

This repository contains a CSL style file for exporting Biblatex citations with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).

The file is work-in-progress. I have not uploaded it yet to the [Zotero style repositories](https://www.zotero.org/styles), as it cannot be relied upon. Use at your own danger.


# Acknowledgement
